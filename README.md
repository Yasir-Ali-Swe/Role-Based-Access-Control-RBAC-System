# 🛡️ Role-Based Authentication System (RBAC)

This project is a **learning-focused implementation** of authentication and protected routes based on user roles (**User & Admin**) using the **MERN Stack**.

## 📌 Project Purpose
The main goal of this project is to understand:
- 🔑 **Authentication** (JWT-based)
- 🚦 **Protected Routes** (for logged-in users)
- 🛂 **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- ⚡ **Defining Routes for Different Users**
